    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The platform can leverage user-generated data and existing art databases to evaluate ratings. Although there is a wealth of informal data, formal quality metrics or structured datasets may be limited.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions around art ratings may involve subjective opinions, presenting challenges in automating this process while still catering to diverse artistic perspectives.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing social media frameworks and APIs can be relatively straightforward, given the platform's reliance on user interactions and common web technologies.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – There is high volume potential as users will repeatedly engage with the platform, providing numerous opportunities for automation in collecting and analyzing ratings.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The system has strong potential for recognizing trends in user ratings, which can provide insights into emerging artistic styles and preferences that benefit both artists and collectors.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The platform can easily scale to accommodate thousands of users, with infrastructure supporting growth in user engagement without significant additional costs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Given the subjective nature of art, errors in ratings can impact user trust; hence, maintaining accuracy and managing user feedback is crucial to minimize consequences.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is the potential for biases based on user demographics; specific groups may dominate ratings, leading to skewed perspectives that need active monitoring and mitigation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – While the platform will need to comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR, the relatively low regulatory burden for user-generated content simplifies implementation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users and artists may require clarity on how ratings are aggregated and displayed to ensure transparency, though the mechanics can remain user-friendly without heavy technical jargon.</div>

              <div class="small-note"> Note: Each score is on a 0–10 scale. Category totals are averages of sub-categories (also 0–10).</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The platform would require a significant amount of user-generated data for ratings and feedback, but general data about user preferences in art is readily available from social media platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – While the platform is primarily structured around user ratings, subjective opinions on art can complicate decision-making, necessitating clear guidelines for evaluation criteria.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integration with existing social media and art platforms can be moderately challenging, depending on the APIs available from these platforms, but existing frameworks can facilitate this.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The repetitive nature of collecting ratings and filtering content provides a strong foundation for automation, allowing the platform to efficiently handle large volumes of input.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The potential to recognize trends in art ratings can lead to substantial insights for both users and artists, although distinguishing quality can be subjective.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – The platform has high scalability potential as it could expand to include various forms of art and user-generated content across diverse communities.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in art ratings could potentially damage reputations and user trust, but the platform's design can mitigate these risks with clear guidelines.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is potential for bias based on users rating art samples from specific demographics more favorably, necessitating careful monitoring of who is represented.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 4 – Compliance with data protection laws is crucial, especially in gathering user data, but direct regulatory oversight specific to AI-generated art remains limited.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – While users may not demand high levels of technical explainability, the rationale behind the ratings system needs to be clear to foster trust and avoid misuse.</div>

              <div class="small-note"> Note: Each score is on a 0–10 scale. Category totals are averages of sub-categories (also 0–10).</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – The platform will need access to user-generated ratings and historical data on AI-generated art. Given the abundance of online art platforms and social media, data availability is relatively high, but reliability and consistency may vary.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The platform's decision-making is straightforward with the majority relying on user ratings. However, nuances in creativity assessments could complicate automation, requiring initial human oversight.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integrating user feedback loops and existing art databases is feasible, especially with APIs from popular platforms. However, ensuring seamless interactions between varying systems might pose challenges.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – The platform can generate a high volume of user feedback continuously, allowing for automation in data collection and moderation. However, the qualitative nature of art ratings may introduce variability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – There’s significant potential to analyze user ratings over time to identify trends and best practices in AI-generated art, yielding actionable insights for both artists and platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – The platform is highly scalable, able to incorporate additional artist profiles and user segments, but may face limitations in maintaining quality control as the user base grows too quickly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in the rating system could misrepresent artists' work, impacting reputations. However, the platform can implement mechanisms to allow user feedback to correct low-stakes errors.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is a potential risk of bias in ratings based on user demographics or preferences. Careful design and diverse user engagement strategies are needed to mitigate these concerns.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance with data privacy regulations (like GDPR) is essential since user data will be collected. While regulations are manageable, they impose a need for clear data handling policies.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 4 – While the platform's ratings are based on user input and relatively transparent, the interpretation of 'creativity' may require deeper explanation, particularly as it relates to algorithmic suggestions or changes.</div>
