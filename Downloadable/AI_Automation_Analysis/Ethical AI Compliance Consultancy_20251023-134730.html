    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 3</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 4 – The framework relies heavily on obtaining structured regulatory data, which may be fragmented across different jurisdictions, limiting immediate availability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 2 – Compliance decisions often involve significant human judgement and interpretation of ambiguous regulations, making them difficult to automate.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 2 – Integrating with existing compliance management systems can be challenging due to disparate systems and protocols across organizations.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 5 – The auditing framework would address compliance review processes that, while not daily, occur regularly enough across organizations to warrant automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – There is potential for anomaly detection in compliance reporting; however, the initial data patterns are often complex and varied based on industry.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The framework can be adapted to various industries and regulatory requirements, thus showing good potential for scale once established.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 3 – A low tolerance for errors in compliance tasks limits full automation, mandating thorough human oversight.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – Bias risk is present if the AI tools used in auditing are trained on biased datasets, potentially skewing compliance judgments.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – The compliance auditing framework must navigate complex regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, which heavily influence data handling and model applicability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 8 – Due to the critical nature of compliance decisions, there is a strong requirement for transparent and interpretable AI models to facilitate trust and accountability.</div>
