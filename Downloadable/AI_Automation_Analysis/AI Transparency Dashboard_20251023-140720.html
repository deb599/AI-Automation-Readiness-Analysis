              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The implementation requires access to various data sources documenting decision-making processes, which are typically available in AI systems but may vary in format and standardization.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The dashboard needs to present both structured decisions (e.g., classification outcomes) and more complex subjective decisions (e.g., recommendations), requiring careful design to manage user expectations.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 7 – Integration with existing systems is feasible, as many modern platforms have APIs available; however, legacy systems may pose challenges that need to be addressed.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 5 – While high-volume interactions could lead to significant efficiency improvements, the primary value comes from user trust rather than task automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The dashboard could facilitate the detection of bias and patterns in decision-making, providing critical insights that enhance the user experience.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The transparency dashboard can be implemented across multiple departments and scaled organization-wide with relative ease once initial user feedback is processed.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 7 – While the dashboard itself carries some error tolerance in displaying data, errors in the underlying AI processes could lead to significant compliance issues. Thus, rigorous testing will be essential.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – There is inherent risk of bias in the AI outputs being visualized; the dashboard must address these risks to avoid misrepresentation of AI capabilities.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – Given increased scrutiny on AI fairness and transparency, this dashboard directly aligns with emerging regulations such as GDPR, presenting an important compliance tool.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 8 – Users from different backgrounds will require various levels of interpretability; thus, the dashboard must be flexible enough to cater to both technical and non-technical users simultaneously.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The dashboard requires access to structured data from AI models and their outputs. While data quality is crucial, most organizations already maintain logs and records that can be leveraged for this purpose.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The AI decisions being traced can range from straightforward to complex. While the majority of decisions can be explained through clear metrics, some may require substantial understanding of the underlying algorithms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integrating with existing systems is feasible, but it relies on the level of API maturity. Most platforms today provide sufficient API functionality, with the main concern being the alignment of data formats.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 6 – While creating a dashboard isn't a repetitive task in itself, the insights gathered can be used repeatedly across various departments, enhancing operational efficiency with a clearer understanding of AI.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The potential for pattern recognition is high as users can learn from previous decisions. This can lead to better decision-making over time by enabling insights based on historical data.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The dashboard can be scaled across departments, but different divisions may have varying requirements that need to be accounted for in future iterations to maintain relevance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – While the consequences of errors in the dashboard presentation are relatively low, misleading information might lead to distrust, which makes maintaining accuracy imperative.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 4 – While transparency can help expose bias in AI systems, the initial data used may still be biased. It is essential to monitor and validate data sources continuously.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – With increasing regulations surrounding AI transparency, the project aligns well with current regulatory trends; however, compliance with laws such as GDPR will require careful implementation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 9 – Given the demand for explainability in AI systems, providing a detailed dashboard will meet both user expectations and compliance needs regarding model interpretability.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The project relies on structured data inputs that are already collected by existing systems. Most necessary data is available but will require cleaning and integration efforts.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions made by the AI are complex but can be broken down into interpretable components. Some subjective evaluations may remain challenging to automate, depending on AI model specifics.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integrating the dashboard with existing platforms may present some challenges due to varied API standards across systems, necessitating careful planning.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – The dashboard supports high-volume decisions where transparency is critical, improving user engagement and operational efficiency.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – By making the decision-making process visible, the dashboard can help identify patterns in user interactions with AI, driving actionable insights.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – This tool can be expanded across multiple departments and user bases as transparency grows in demand, but initial rollout might be limited to pilot teams.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Errors in the display of information can lead to misunderstandings, but overall usage will benefit from a transparency approach, making execution errors less critical.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The AI may unintentionally reflect biases present in underlying data; identifying and mitigating these biases will be essential to ensure fairness.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance will be vital, particularly concerning GDPR and AI ethics frameworks; proactive monitoring and adaptation will be necessary.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 8 – High levels of explainability are needed to ensure user trust, which aligns with the project goal of transparency and is likely to influence future AI model designs.</div>
