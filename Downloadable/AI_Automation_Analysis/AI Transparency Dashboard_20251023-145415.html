              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The required data for this dashboard includes metadata about data sources and model performance, which are often available but may vary greatly in quality across different AI systems.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – While the decisions made by the AI models can be automated, the varying complexity of those models means that some will require more nuanced handling of visualizations.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integrating with existing systems may present challenges due to differing data structures, but many platforms have APIs that can facilitate this process, thus enabling a moderate level of friction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 6 – The dashboard can provide insights on a wide range of AI outputs across various applications, not limited to repetitive tasks, yielding significant overall value.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – By visualizing data correlations and decision influences, the dashboard will aid in recognizing patterns, directly supporting better decision-making processes.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – Once developed, the dashboard could be easily scaled across multiple departments and applications, although ensuring all datasets are standardized might be a limitation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – While the dashboard's errors won't likely lead to catastrophic failures, they could mislead users regarding the integrity of data sources, creating a moderate tolerance threshold.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Transparency can highlight potential biases in the AI data sources, especially if the dataset is not representative, but this can also pose challenges in addressing these biases effectively.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Regulatory frameworks like GDPR are increasingly emphasizing transparency, thus there is a strong alignment with these requirements which can facilitate compliance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 9 – User demand for explainability is high, as stakeholders across an organization will need to understand AI decisions, warranting substantial emphasis on interpretability in the dashboard design.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – Data for the transparency dashboard is likely to include structured logs and user interaction metrics, which are generally available but may vary in quality depending on existing data governance practices.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions made by AI systems can be complex, but presenting them in a user-friendly format allows for simplification; integrating subjective decision metrics would be more challenging.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – While integrating with existing systems is feasible, potential challenges include varying data formats and API compatibility, which might require additional development effort.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 5 – This epic could be applied across various departments, but its repetitive nature in terms of updating dashboard data may not be as high volume in some contexts.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The transparency dashboard will primarily reveal patterns regarding data integrity and sources, providing insights into AI system performance, which has substantial business value.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The dashboard can be easily scaled across different teams and user groups without significant changes to the underlying infrastructure, making it a valuable investment.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – While the consequences of errors in data representation could impact user trust and compliance, the system could be designed to gracefully handle small discrepancies with minimal risk.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias risks may arise if the dashboard highlights only certain data sources or ignores underrepresented groups, making it crucial to ensure diverse data representation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Regulatory frameworks like GDPR are increasingly emphasizing transparency, which aligns with this epic's goals but may result in complexities during implementation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 9 – High explainability is paramount, particularly for compliance and user trust, necessitating a robust framework to disclose the reasoning behind AI decisions clearly.</div>
