              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in message filtering could lead to missed important communications, impacting user trust in the tool; however, the lower stakes compared to critical health or financial services allow for moderate error margins.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is potential for biased filter outcomes based on training data; ensuring diverse contexts and examples is essential to mitigate this risk.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – While regulatory scrutiny exists around user data and privacy (e.g., GDPR), secure messaging platforms likely adhere to these standards, providing a viable path for compliance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users may require insights into why messages are categorized or filtered; thus, the model needs a certain level of explainability, though NLP models can pose challenges in this area.</div>
