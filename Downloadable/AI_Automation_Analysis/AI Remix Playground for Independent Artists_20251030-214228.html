    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The platform needs a diverse dataset of music tracks for training the AI, which can be sourced from public music libraries, ensuring a rich enough context for generating meaningful remixes.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decision-making process will involve a blend of algorithmic suggestions and user input, but the subjective nature of music can complicate automation, requiring thoughtful UI/UX design.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 7 – Integration with music streaming platforms or existing DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) can be achieved through APIs, although this may introduce some friction in user authentication and data exchange.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The platform targets independent artists, a potentially large and repetitive user base looking for unique remix insights without manual effort, creating significant automation potential.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – The ability to analyze existing music tracks for trends and generate remix patterns could provide artists with valuable insights, increasing engagement and satisfaction.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The platform can scale to accommodate more users and incorporate a wider array of musical genres, but infrastructure costs and server load are potential constraints.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – As the tool presents creative suggestions, the tolerance for errors is moderate; however, poor recommendations could impact user trust and satisfaction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is a risk of bias in music recommendations based on training data; underrepresented genres may lead to less diverse output, requiring careful dataset curation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 6 – Compliance with copyright laws and regulations like GDPR is essential, as user-uploaded content could pose legal challenges depending on how data is stored and used.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Artists may require clear explanations on how remix suggestions are generated to build trust; this impacts algorithm design choices and may necessitate simpler, interpretable models.</div>

              <div class="small-note"> Note: Each score is on a 0–10 scale. Category totals are averages of sub-categories (also 0–10).</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – Access to high-quality music data is widely available but may require licensing agreements to use certain tracks for training and testing.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decision-making process involves subjective creativity, but automation can handle repetitive tasks in remix suggestions with machine learning.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The application can leverage existing music production platforms and APIs, making integration relatively low friction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 9 – High volume of indie artists seeking fresh sounds means significant demand and opportunity for automation in generating remix variations.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – AI can effectively analyze and recognize patterns in popular music trends to generate appealing remix suggestions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – The platform can scale quickly, serving a growing number of users with minimal incremental cost once established.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – While errors in suggestions could lead to dissatisfaction, the impact is limited compared to mission-critical systems.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The AI may inadvertently favor certain music styles or voices if training data is not diverse, making deliberate curation essential.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance with copyright laws and permissions for use of training data is crucial and may introduce legal complexities.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 4 – Artists and users may require clarity on how suggestions are generated, but achieving explainability in music generation can be complex.</div>

              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – The availability of diverse music datasets is fairly good, although quality and licensing could be an issue, making it challenging to ensure rich inputs for the AI.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 8 – The decisions to be made regarding remix styles and artist preferences are subjective but can be broken down into algorithmic parameters, allowing moderate automation with user feedback.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integrating AI tools with existing digital audio workstations (DAWs) could pose challenges, requiring careful handling of technical dependencies and user experience.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – The repetitive aspect of generating multiple remix suggestions creates a strong automation potential, catering specifically to independent artists seeking unique outputs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The AI's ability to identify trends in user preferences and successful remix styles can generate significant insights, providing value not just to users but also for market analysis.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – Once established, the platform can easily scale to accommodate an increasing number of users, though server capacity and data management need attention.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Errors in remix suggestions may frustrate artists, but since they have creative control, the impact could be mitigated; however, poor quality outputs could harm reputation.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is a risk of bias in the AI recommendations if the training data is not diverse enough, which could lead to homogeneity in remix outputs; careful dataset curation is needed.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 4 – Compliance with copyright laws and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) is necessary, but the requirements are manageable with proper legal frameworks in place.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – While artists will want to understand how recommendations are generated, complex neural networks may complicate this; balancing interpretability with model performance is essential.</div>
