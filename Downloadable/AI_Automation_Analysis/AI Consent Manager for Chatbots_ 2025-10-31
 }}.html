              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The platform can analyze consent data patterns over time, providing insights into user behavior and preferences, but initial data quality must be ensured.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – Once established, the consent management platform could scale across various chatbot implementations easily, although customization may be needed for different use cases.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Given that errors in consent management can lead to serious compliance issues and user distrust, a low tolerance for mistakes will necessitate robust systems.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – The AI may inadvertently favor certain demographics in the data it uses, requiring careful monitoring and adjustments to ensure fairness.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Compliance with regulations such as GDPR is paramount, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for the platform to stand out as a privacy-first solution.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – The need for explainability is moderate, as users will want to understand how their data is being managed, but the technical details can remain somewhat abstract to most users.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The project will require access to a variety of user data sets that are often scattered across different systems. While some data might be readily accessible, ensuring accuracy and compliance will present challenges.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The decisions surrounding consent management will require both structured inputs (like user preferences) and subjective interpretation (like context of use). This complexity can be indirectly automated but will require significant design.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integrating with existing chatbot systems will have technical dependencies based on the variety of platforms in use. There may be friction points in adapting diverse APIs and ensuring seamless interaction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The volume of interactions with chatbots is high, resulting in substantial repetitive tasks related to consent preferences. Automation in this area can significantly reduce manual oversight.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – By analyzing consent data and interactions, the platform could detect usage patterns that inform user preferences and improve the chatbot experience, generating valuable insights for businesses.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – This consent management platform can be easily scaled across various chatbots and industries, allowing it to meet diverse user needs and compliance requirements simultaneously.</div>
