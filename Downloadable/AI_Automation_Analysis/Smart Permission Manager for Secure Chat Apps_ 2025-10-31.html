              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 9 – Data requirements are mostly low as they revolve around user preferences and settings, which can be easily collected and stored. Given that the application relies on established API frameworks, data is readily available.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 7 – Decision complexity is moderate because while some decisions can be standardized, user-specific preferences might lead to subjective outcomes that require careful user interface design.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing chat applications should be feasible through APIs that allow permission configurations. However, potential friction points may arise from varying platform policies and security protocols.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The app addresses repetitive tasks of setting permissions, allowing automation and customization for users, which can lead to considerable time savings on the user’s end.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – While there is potential to detect patterns in user permissions and preferences, the data collected may not be extensive enough for sophisticated insights, impacting overall value.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias risks are moderate, as the application could inadvertently favor certain user groups based on demographic data, requiring attention to diverse representation in design and functionality.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Compliance with regulations like GDPR is essential, given the focus on personal data and privacy. However, the structure of the app allows for straightforward compliance mechanisms to be built in.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Explainability is important for users to understand their permissions and settings, but the technical concerns are manageable, given that they can be communicated effectively through user interface design.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The implementation relies on user data and permission settings, both of which can be structured through existing API integrations. Data availability is contingent on user consent, which could be challenging to standardize across platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decision framework involves setting user-defined rules and thresholds, which can be subjective. Designing intuitive interfaces to manage these preferences increases complexity but is feasible with user testing.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – Integration with popular chat applications is generally low friction, as many utilize open APIs. However, varying privacy policies across platforms could complicate uniform implementation.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – As AI usage in chat applications rises, the volume of user interactions requiring permissions can be significant, providing high automation potential to streamline these processes.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The tool can help identify usage patterns and preferences among users concerning their privacy, leading to actionable insights and optimizations for AI interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – The solution can be scaled easily to various platforms and user segments, especially if it leverages modular API structures. However, it may face limitations in adopting across smaller, less popular platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – While user control over permissions can mitigate risks, errors in settings could lead to significant privacy breaches, especially if users assume defaults without understanding the implications.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias risks can arise if permissions are based on user interactions that may favor certain demographics or use cases. Ensuring a diverse dataset in training AI components can help mitigate these risks.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Compliance with regulations such as GDPR will be critical, especially since user data is involved. The rigorous requirements for user consent must be seamlessly integrated into the workflow.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users require a clear understanding of how their permissions are being utilized, necessitating transparent explanations of AI decisions which could slow down deployment if not adequately addressed.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The integration would mostly require user permission settings and typical chat interaction data, which are generally accessible but may face challenges in handling different chat app APIs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – While most permission settings can be standardized, individual user preferences can introduce subjectivity that complicates automation slightly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – Given existing frameworks for browser extensions, integration should be straightforward with existing chat application APIs presenting minor friction points.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The need for frequent permission adjustments makes this a highly repetitive task, allowing for strong automation potential to prevent permission misuse.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – Some patterns in permission usage might emerge but are heavily dependent on user behavior variance and the diverse nature of chat applications.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – This solution can easily be applied across multiple chat platforms and user demographics, increasing its potential reach and adoption significantly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 7 – Errors in permissions could lead to privacy violations, making the tool sensitive to inaccuracies, yet the implications vary based on user profiles.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The solution needs to account for varying user backgrounds and preferences, though the impact of bias is relatively contained due to individual controls.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Regulatory frameworks like GDPR will demand strict adherence to user data processing and permissions management, which requires careful attention during development.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users need to understand how their permissions are set and managed, requiring a degree of explainability in design, but this does not complicate the AI model choices significantly.</div>
