              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – To succeed, the system needs diverse datasets for effective training, including various languages and moderation contexts. While such data exists in abundance on chat platforms, it requires careful curation to avoid skewed results.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The moderation decisions involve both structured data inputs (e.g., offensive keywords) and subjective user input, requiring sophisticated models that can learn from dynamic patterns in user behavior, adding complexity.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integrating a decentralized structure with existing chat platforms poses challenges due to varied technologies in use. There could be friction in interoperability, which needs to be addressed to attract users.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Moderation is a frequently repeated task on chat platforms, which allows substantial automation potential through AI. High-volume user interactions create significant opportunities for efficiency.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – AI can effectively detect emerging behavioral patterns and content trends, providing insights that can enhance community guidelines and user experience based on historical data.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The solution could easily be scaled to different communities and languages, but nuances in cultural moderation norms may require tailored adaptations that could slow universal deployment.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in content moderation can lead to severe community backlash or legal repercussions, requiring a high standard of accuracy and oversight, hence the lower tolerance for mistakes.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The AI system could inadvertently reinforce biases present in the training data, particularly against niche community expressions. This necessitates careful monitoring and continuous retraining protocols.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance with regulations, including GDPR, is critical, which could add complexity to the design and implementation phases. However, establishing user control may align well with privacy laws, somewhat easing these constraints.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – End-users and moderators will need clarity on moderation decisions to maintain trust. This requires transparent AI models, which can complicate the use of deep learning techniques favored for pattern recognition.</div>
