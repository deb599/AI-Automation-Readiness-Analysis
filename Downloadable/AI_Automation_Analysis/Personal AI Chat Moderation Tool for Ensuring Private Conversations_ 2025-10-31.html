              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – The tool requires access to chat transcripts that may already be stored by existing chat programs. However, privacy settings and user consent will need careful consideration.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 7 – Decision complexity is moderate since identifying sensitive information involves recognizing context, which can be subjective but also has established patterns.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing chat platforms is feasible as modern web applications can be extended with browser plugins. However, interoperability challenges may arise due to different data formats.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Since chat communication is highly repetitive, automating the monitoring of sensitive information has significant potential for widespread usage and high volume.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – This tool can effectively detect patterns of sensitive information across conversations, providing actionable insights for users concerned about privacy.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The solution can be easily scaled to accommodate more users or integrated into more chat platforms, allowing for extensive market reach.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors could lead to unintended sharing of sensitive information, making robustness critical. However, user control features can mitigate this risk.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – Bias risks arise if the detection algorithms misinterpret different cultural contexts of sensitive information. Training on diverse datasets can help mitigate this.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance with regulations like GDPR is essential, particularly regarding data retention and user consent for monitoring chats.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – While not all users need an explanation of how sensitive information is flagged, some stakeholders will require transparency in AI decisions, influencing model choice.</div>

              <div class="small-note"> Note: Each score is on a 0–10 scale. Category totals are averages of sub-categories (also 0–10).</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The tool requires access to conversation transcripts, which are typically available in user chat systems. However, incorporating context-aware analysis may require nuanced data structures.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – While identifying sensitive information can be automated, understanding context may introduce complexity due to subjective interpretations and user-specific settings.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing chat platforms is feasible since many already provide APIs. Potential friction lies in varying platform permissions and user software environments.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Many users engage in repetitive chat activities daily, providing high volumes of data for moderation. However, customization needs may limit full automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – High potential to recognize patterns in language use and sensitive information trends, though initial thresholds must be configured based on diverse user groups.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The concept scales efficiently across various chat platforms, allowing broad adoption. Although scaling might be limited by the differing privacy standards across regions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in flagging sensitive information could lead to privacy breaches, necessitating strict testing phases to minimize risks, especially involving confidential discussions.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – Algorithmic biases may arise in how sensitive information is flagged, especially across diverse cultural contexts. Regular audits and user feedback will be essential for mitigation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – The tool must navigate various regulations like GDPR which govern data handling, making compliance a priority, particularly regarding user consent and data storage policies.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users will require explanations for why certain messages are flagged, pushing for a transparent user interface in the decision-making process of the AI to establish trust.</div>

              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The tool requires access to users' chat histories to function effectively, yet it depends on the varying availability and formats of chat data across different platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – Most decisions made by the tool can be automated through natural language processing, but some edge cases will require more complex subjective judgment.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – As a browser extension, it can easily integrate into existing chat platforms with straightforward API hooks, minimizing friction points.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Given the frequent exchanges in chat, this tool can handle high-volume tasks such as monitoring messages for sensitive content, which is repetitive and suitable for automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The tool can leverage AI to identify patterns in language use that may indicate sensitive content, providing significant added value based on user behavior analytics.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – While the tool can scale across multiple platforms and user bases, variations in chat platform architectures may pose some constraints.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in flagging sensitive information could lead to privacy violations, yet the impact can be mitigated through user feedback mechanisms.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The AI model could inadvertently introduce biases if not trained on a representative dataset, potentially mislabeling neutral content as sensitive.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – As the tool deals directly with personal data, it must navigate strict regulations like GDPR, which affects design and implementation timelines.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users and regulatory bodies will require understanding of how decisions are made by the AI, necessitating interpretability without overly complicating the model.</div>
