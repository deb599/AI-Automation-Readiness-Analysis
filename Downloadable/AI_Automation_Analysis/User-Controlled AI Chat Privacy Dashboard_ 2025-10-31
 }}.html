              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The project requires access to user chat data, which is generally available but may necessitate robust encryption and secure access protocols to ensure compliance with privacy standards.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The dashboard will involve structured decision-making for data control options, allowing for straightforward implementation with some subjective user preference considerations.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing chat systems should be smooth using APIs, although there may be some challenges with legacy systems that lack modern data management capabilities.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – The proposed dashboard will address high-volume user interactions by enabling bulk management of chat data, significantly enhancing user experience and ensuring repeat interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – While the primary focus is on user control, there is potential for analytics on user behavior that could inform further product development and tailoring of AI interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – This initiative can be scaled across various platforms, and the modular nature of a dashboard allows adaptation for different services and user bases with relatively low overhead.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 7 – Errors in data management could lead to user dissatisfaction and trust issues, but mitigation strategies (e.g., user confirmations) can reduce the risks of severe consequences.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – While the dashboard itself does not inherently trigger bias, the underlying AI must handle diverse user inputs fairly, requiring careful monitoring to mitigate potential harms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – Strong compliance with regulations such as GDPR is crucial, and this initiative aligns well with current data protection laws, potentially providing a competitive edge in privacy offerings.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users will benefit from clear explanations of data usage and retention behaviors, and while less complex than predictive AI models, the transparency remains critical for user trust.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – User data is typically available from existing chat logs, providing opportunities to access necessary information. However, ensuring complete historical data integrity may pose challenges.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions involve varied user preferences regarding data handling, presenting complexity; yet, well-defined choices can be automated to streamline user interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – Integration with existing systems should be straightforward, as many services already have some level of data management infrastructure in place, minimizing friction points.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 5 – The dashboard's functionality is less about repeating tasks and more about user engagement, which may create significant value through improved user trust and privacy assurance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The system could potentially analyze usage patterns around data management preferences, offering insights that could enhance privacy services.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – This solution could be easily scaled to a large number of users across various platforms, with minimal customization needed for different services.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in user data management could lead to significant compliance issues and loss of trust, necessitating robust validation mechanisms to mitigate risks.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There are inherent risks regarding biases in user preferences; depending on the demographic of users, the dashboard needs to be sensitive to diverse needs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – The dashboard must comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR, which could enhance its value by assuring users that their privacy is prioritized.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users require clear explanations of how their data is used and managed, which necessitates transparent backend mechanisms to provide interpretability.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The project primarily requires structured data about user interactions and their preferences. Given that many systems already log this data, it is largely available and of good quality, though integration into a cohesive dashboard could require additional structuring.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – Most decisions about data visibility and user preferences can be automated, but defining user-specific settings may involve subjective decisions that complicate the implementation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The integration with existing back-end systems should be straightforward since it builds upon current logging frameworks, with potential friction points related to legacy systems.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Providing users with control over their data can be a high-volume operation if scaled across many users, as daily interactions with AI chat services can be substantial.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – While the feature does not primarily focus on pattern recognition, it could provide aggregated insights on user behavior, which may have value but requires careful consideration to avoid invasive analytics.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The dashboard can easily scale to accommodate a massive number of users and interactions due to its lightweight design and reliance on existing infrastructure.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in user data handling could lead to trust issues, which are critical in privacy contexts. However, the dashboard design aims to minimize such risks by emphasizing user control.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The risk of bias is moderate as the dashboard must be designed to address the privacy concerns of diverse user groups, requiring careful consideration of their varying needs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Given regulations like GDPR, the tool must ensure compliance with data handling and user rights. This is vital to mitigate legal risks and build user trust.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Users may require explanations about how their data is being used or processed. Thus, the need for transparency in data handling necessitates a clear and interpretable user interface and logic.</div>
