              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – Data on user interactions is often stored in structured formats, making it easier to retrieve and manage. However, there may be limitations based on how different providers implement their storage solutions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions users need to make can be relatively straightforward, but incorporating all data handling options could complicate the interface. User experience design will be critical.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Integration with existing data management systems is feasible, as most platforms already track user interaction history. However, there will be friction in aligning diverse data policies across service providers.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Given the high volume of interactions across user bases, providing privacy controls will meet a critical demand. The repetitive nature of interactions with chatbots encourages user engagement with the dashboard.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The ability to recognize user patterns in data management could provide valuable insights for both users and service providers, leading to continual improvement of privacy features.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – This solution can easily scale across various user interfaces and platforms, allowing wider adoption with minimal adaptation needed, although differing regulatory environments may add some constraints.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in data management can lead to significant user trust issues and regulatory repercussions, emphasizing the need for robust systems, though user actions such as deleting conversations mitigate some risks.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – The risk of bias is lower in this context since the dashboard primarily places emphasis on user control and transparency rather than algorithm-based outcomes, but vigilance is necessary to ensure equitable features for all users.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – The solution is heavily influenced by GDPR and similar data protection laws, making compliance easier to achieve with a user-controlled framework while simultaneously needing to be adaptable to potential changes in regulations.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – While the technical aspects behind data storage are not complex, conveying the privacy options and implications to users in an understandable way will be essential for user adoption and trust.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – User chat data is already collected; however, ensuring user deletion requests are efficiently processed requires robust data handling capabilities.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – Decision-making is primarily structured around user input but requires user-friendly design to facilitate an intuitive interface for data management.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – Integration with existing data management systems is feasible, given the use of standard APIs and frameworks, although legacy systems may pose challenges.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – As users frequently interact with chat interfaces, automating data management processes greatly enhances user experience and satisfaction.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 5 – While the feature enables basic data insights, its primary aim is user control rather than extensive pattern detection, limiting its analytical potential.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – Once developed, the dashboard could easily be rolled out across platforms and user segments, although user education may be required for widespread adoption.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in data handling could lead to privacy breaches, making it crucial to have robust compliance measures in place to rectify any mismanagement.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 4 – The primary concern lies in ensuring the dashboard does not inadvertently incorporate bias in data visualizations, which may impact user understanding.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – Compliance with regulations like GDPR is built into the design, enhancing user trust by ensuring data rights are upheld, though monitoring will be necessary.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users require clear explanations of how their data is used, necessitating a straightforward approach to transparency that impacts design considerations.</div>
