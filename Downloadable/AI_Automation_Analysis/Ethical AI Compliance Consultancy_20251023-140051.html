              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 5 – The initiative requires access to various data sources, including operational logs and compliance checklists, which may not always be available in a structured format. However, many businesses have started maintaining compliance records, offering a moderate level of data availability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 7 – Compliance auditing involves multiple structured decisions based on defined regulations, which lend themselves to automation. However, subjective interpretations of compliance guidelines may complicate automation efforts.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Compliance auditing tools need to interface with existing IT systems for data collection, which can vary in complexity. Existing systems may provide APIs, but legacy systems could create integration challenges.</div>
