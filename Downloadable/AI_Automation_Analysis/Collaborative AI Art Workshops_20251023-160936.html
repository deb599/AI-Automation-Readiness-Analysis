              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – To develop this platform, substantial data on artists' interaction with AI, as well as AI-generated artworks, will be necessary. While data exists, organizing and harnessing it effectively poses a moderate challenge.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – Many decisions will be subjective, requiring human oversight to ensure artistic quality, but some aspects can be automated, which helps with decision-making speed.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The integration with existing artistic tools and software can be achieved, as many platforms are increasingly open to API integrations, but some proprietary systems may offer resistance.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 5 – Workshops can accommodate a range of engagement levels, but repetition in workshop content may lead to diminishing returns on learning, balancing ideas shared versus unique insights gained.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The platform can facilitate pattern recognition in artistic trends through data analysis of workshop outputs, providing significant insights into emerging artistic styles.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 6 – While the workshops can be scaled through online platforms, the need for skilled facilitators may limit rapid expansion and place a ceiling on growth.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Artistic errors may have subjective consequences, but framework compliance and adherence to educational standards are critical, increasing the need for accuracy.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – There is a risk of bias if only certain art styles or backgrounds are represented in the platform's data. Mitigating this requires active curation of diverse artistic inputs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 4 – The workshops must comply with intellectual property laws and GDPR, especially concerning data collected from artists and AI-produced artworks.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Artists will need to understand how AI influences their work, requiring the platform to provide clear explanations of AI outputs, enhancing trust and creative collaboration.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – This platform will require a diverse dataset of artistic styles and user interactions; while some data is available, quality and diversity may vary across different artistic mediums.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The decisions made during the workshops would require subjective evaluation of artistic merit and technical integration, which can complicate automation but also offers opportunity for collaborative input.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integration with existing tools and platforms (like Adobe Creative Suite) is feasible but may present friction in terms of API compatibility and ensuring a smooth user experience.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – While the workshops will not feature repetitive tasks per se, the platform scalability can help reach many artists, creating a high-volume impact in education and adoption of AI in art.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – The potential to analyze user-generated content and feedback for trends is significant, and could contribute valuable insights for both artists and AI developers.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – To effectively run the workshops, data on participant skill levels, AI capabilities, and feedback mechanisms must be collected and analyzed. Data availability might be a challenge, especially with varying degrees of AI familiarity among artists.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – While decisions regarding workshop content can be structured, individual artist preferences will introduce subjectivity. However, the integration of AI can help streamline some decisions allowing for an easier automation pathway.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The platform can be integrated with existing educational tools and platforms used by institutions. However, ensuring compatibility across diverse educational systems could introduce some friction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – The workshops would not be repetitive but could scale with more sessions and diverse topics over time. However, there are limits on how many artists can be trained simultaneously without dilution of quality.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – Workshops would generate valuable insights into how artists engage with AI, potentially revealing patterns that could enhance future artistic collaborations and training programs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 6 – The concept can be scaled to various institutions and different regions but would require significant resources and partnerships to be effective across the board.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Errors in the workshops, such as technical malfunctions or misunderstandings of AI tools, could lead to artistic frustrations but aren't likely to result in compliance issues.</div>
