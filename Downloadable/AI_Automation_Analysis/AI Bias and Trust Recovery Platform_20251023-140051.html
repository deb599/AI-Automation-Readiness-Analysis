              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The project requires a diverse dataset that captures various demographics and contexts, which is increasingly available through partnerships and public datasets, although some categories may remain underrepresented.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – While the decision-making process can be structured around bias detection algorithms, subjective interpretations of bias remain a challenge, making automation moderately complex.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integrating bias detection tools into existing AI systems may face friction points related to legacy architectures and varying data formats, yet APIs and modular designs can facilitate integration.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 6 – Monitoring for bias can be repetitive given frequent model updates, but the volume greatly depends on the number of deployed AI models across departments.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – The ability to detect nuanced patterns of bias in decision-making algorithms presents significant potential value-driven insights, as many companies lack robust solutions in this area.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The platform can be scaled across different functions and industries, but each deployment may require customization, which can slow scalability slightly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Errors in bias detection could lead to reputational damage and compliance issues, but the consequences can vary depending on the specific application and audience involved.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 8 – There is significant potential for bias risks, especially in underrepresented groups, as automated systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases without thorough oversight.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – Compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR and fairness laws poses challenges that can complicate implementation timelines, as data handling must be closely monitored.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – The need for explainability is high among stakeholders, including regulators and the end-users whose decisions could be affected by biased algorithms, necessitating clear interpretability frameworks.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – Bias mitigation strategies require extensive datasets that reflect diverse demographics. Organizations often have rich data sources, but these can be incomplete or skewed, requiring careful curation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – Mitigating bias involves both structured data analysis and qualitative assessments. Automated decision-making can face challenges due to the nuanced nature of bias, which may complicate full automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integrating bias detection tools into existing AI systems can involve significant technical challenges. Current workflows may need rules and heuristics adapted to accommodate these new capabilities.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – Bias detection can be a repetitive task for humans, especially across multiple AI systems. Automating this can significantly reduce manual oversight and increase overall system reliability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – The ability to identify patterns of bias across large datasets can yield significant insights, allowing organizations to adjust their approaches and improve outcomes for underrepresented groups.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – Once developed, the bias mitigation tools can be scaled across various business units quickly. However, customization for different applications may still be required.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in bias detection can lead to serious consequences, including exacerbating inequality. Organizations must tread carefully, ensuring that any automated decisions come with a high level of scrutiny.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 9 – Bias risk is significant in AI; failing to address it can perpetuate inequalities and damage reputations. Identifying and mitigating these biases is both ethically and operationally urgent.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – With increasing regulatory scrutiny around AI fairness (e.g., GDPR, upcoming AI laws), compliance becomes a priority. The need to document and justify algorithms adds time to development and deployment.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Stakeholders, including consumers and regulators, increasingly demand transparency. Ensuring that AI biases can be explained and understood requires additional effort in model design and reporting.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – There is a wealth of historical user interaction data available, but it may be fragmented and of varying quality due to different systems used across departments.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The decision-making process involves both structured (data-derived insights) and subjective aspects (user perceptions), complicating automation but also creating opportunities for nuanced resolutions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The tools are likely to integrate with existing customer relationship management (CRM) and user feedback systems without significant friction, although legacy systems may pose some challenges.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – User feedback mechanisms and monitoring can be high-volume due to their repetitive nature, but they lack the complexity to yield drastic automation potential on their own.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 10 – Patterns of user engagement and bias detection can yield actionable insights that not only improve the product but also enhance overall user satisfaction and trust.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – Once established, this tool can easily scale across different user demographics and departments, though tailoring it to specific groups may require some effort.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in this context can lead to diminished trust or compliance issues, especially if transparency fails; however, careful design can moderate the negative impact.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 9 – The potential risk of perpetuating bias is significant, especially if underrepresented groups are not adequately considered during the development process.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 7 – GDPR and other AI fairness laws impose strict guidelines, and compliance can prolong the development timeline but is essential for credibility.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 8 – Stakeholders require clear explanations of AI processes, particularly in a tool aimed at bias mitigation, which demands advanced model interpretability to ensure user trust.</div>
