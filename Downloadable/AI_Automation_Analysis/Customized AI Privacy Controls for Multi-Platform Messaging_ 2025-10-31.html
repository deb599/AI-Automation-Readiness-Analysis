              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 5 – The project would require diverse datasets pertaining to user interaction data and privacy settings across various messaging platforms. While some data may be available through APIs, access might be limited and require user consent.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – Decision-making involves both structured data for privacy settings and subjective factors related to user preferences. The capability to automate these decisions is moderate, depending on user input and platform variability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 7 – Integration with various messaging platforms presents challenges due to differing APIs and potential lack of standardization. However, with substantial software development investment, integration can achieve high connectivity.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – High-volume interactions across messaging platforms present opportunities for automation and efficiency, particularly in enforcing privacy controls. This volume is not completely automated due to the need for personal user choices.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – There is strong potential for the AI to recognize patterns in user communications and potential privacy risks, providing actionable insights and personalized alerts. Existing machine learning models can be applied effectively.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 6 – The solution can scale well across multiple platforms and user bases; however, regulatory and technical constraints may limit extensive reach initially.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – High-stakes operational errors in privacy settings could lead to significant user trust erosion. While designing the system with fail-safes would mitigate some risk, complete error avoidance is improbable.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias in AI could arise from underrepresentation of certain demographics in training data, potentially leading to unequal privacy protection. Continuous monitoring will be critical to mitigate these risks.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – The tool must operate within stringent frameworks like GDPR and data protection laws which prohibit data misuse. Compliance will require ongoing legal consultation and system adjustments.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users and regulators demand transparency in AI decision-making processes, necessitating clear explanations for privacy alerts and settings. This will require designing user-friendly interfaces to convey complex AI reasoning.</div>
