    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The data needed for this dashboard is largely structured and should be readily available from the systems that generated the AI outputs. However, ensuring data integrity might pose some challenges.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions made by the AI can range from straightforward recommendations based on clear data inputs to complex interpretations that require nuanced explanations, posing varying degrees of complexity for end-user understanding.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 9 – Integrating existing systems with this dashboard is expected to be largely frictionless, given that it's primarily a visualization layer. Most current systems have APIs that facilitate easy data extraction.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – As companies adopt AI more broadly, the volume of decisions made daily can be vast. Providing transparency on these decisions could significantly enhance user engagement and retention.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The dashboard can facilitate pattern recognition in AI decision-making, thereby generating insights into the AI behavior and allowing users to leverage this for improved business strategies.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 10 – The tool can be deployed across different teams and business units with minimal adjustments, making it easy to scale as a necessity grows across the organization.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 7 – While the dashboard will help to clarify AI outputs, any significant errors could still impact compliance and operational efficacy, necessitating robust error handling and user guidance.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The transparency offered by the dashboard may reveal biases present in the AI training data; however, the ability to mitigate these biases may be constrained by available remedies.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 6 – Given the growing landscape of AI regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act), the project must align closely with legal standards but is manageable within the proposed compliance frameworks.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – The demand for explainability in AI is high, especially for regulated industries; this dashboard aims to address those needs, but depth of detail may vary based on user requirements and model complexity.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – Most modern AI systems generate vast amounts of data with established metrics for integrity; however, consolidating this data from multiple sources may require significant effort.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decisions made by AI can vary from straightforward recommendations to complex multi-factor analyses, necessitating both qualitative and quantitative insights.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – Existing APIs largely support integration with many data sources, though legacy systems may pose some integration challenges.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 8 – Transparency demand is high. As more organizations adopt AI, the drive for clear insights into AI decision-making increases, enabling better user engagement and trust.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 9 – This dashboard allows for the identification of trends and anomalies in AI outputs, providing strategic insights that can enhance business decision-making.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – Once developed, the dashboard can be deployed across departments, but customization for industry-specific needs may slow broad adoption.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – While transparency can reduce the risk of misunderstandings, errors in displayed data could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential legal repercussions.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – If not managed properly, visibility into AI decision processes could inadvertently highlight existing biases, particularly if the data feeding the AI is biased.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – The need for compliance with laws such as GDPR mandates that user data transparency is included, giving this initiative both high relevance and regulatory challenges.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 9 – For users and stakeholders, understanding AI decisions is critical, demanding clear interpretability that must be built into the dashboard's design.</div>
