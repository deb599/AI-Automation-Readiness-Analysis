    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>
