              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – While the system itself may not rely on repetitive tasks, the volume of user interactions can generate substantial data points, increasing the potential value of the consent registry over time.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 6 – There is potential to recognize patterns in consent preferences, enabling better tailoring of AI interactions to user desires and improving engagement, though initial implementation may face hurdles.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 5 – The decentralized model allows for scaling across various platforms and user bases, yet the need for compliance and technical standards may limit rapid scalability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 2 – Errors in user consent management could lead to severe compliance issues and reputational damage, making any tolerance for such errors minimal.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – The project must navigate potential biases in user consent preferences. Without careful design, underrepresented groups could be overlooked, complicating compliance and ethical standards.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – This epic faces substantial regulatory scrutiny, particularly with GDPR and other privacy laws, which could complicate implementation and timelines significantly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Users and regulatory authorities will require high levels of transparency and explainability regarding how consent decisions are made, which could complicate AI integration and model choice.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 4</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 5 – Effective operation of the decentralized registry hinges on high-quality consent data and user interactions, requiring robust data collection mechanisms from various sources, which may be incomplete or inconsistent.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The system will need to facilitate both structured consent agreements and subjective user preferences, which adds layers of complexity in decision-making and potential for conflict in preferences.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 3 – Integrating blockchain technology with existing legacy systems presents significant technical friction points, primarily due to disparate data architectures and existing compliance frameworks that may not align.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – High-volume scenarios of consent management across multiple users and applications present strong automation opportunities, significantly reducing manual overhead and enhancing trust.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 5 – While recognizing patterns in consent trends can yield insights into user behavior, the nature of the data may limit useful correlations that can be generalized across varied contexts.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 9 – The potential for scaling across different sectors and geographical regions is substantial, but may be constrained by varying regulatory environments and user acceptance of blockchain technology.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Given the sensitive nature of consent data, errors could have serious compliance implications, warranting high levels of accuracy and trustworthiness in the system.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – There is an inherent risk of bias in consent capture mechanisms that may not encompass diverse user populations adequately, emphasizing the need for inclusive design strategies to mitigate potential disparities.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Navigating complex regulatory landscapes such as GDPR and CCPA presents challenges, but the blockchain solution could provide enhanced compliance tracking capabilities if implemented correctly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – While blockchain technology can enhance transparency, the underlying AI algorithms still require interpretability for end-users, necessitating careful design choices that balance security and usability.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 3</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 4 – Data required for consent tracking and user preferences must be accurately captured, noting that user identity management and privacy are paramount challenges that may limit data availability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The decision-making process is complex due to the need to reconcile multiple consent layers and data types, but some aspects could benefit from automation given standardized user interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 2 – Integration with existing systems will face friction due to varying protocols across platforms, requiring significant custom development to address compatibility issues.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 6 – While user consent logging might not be exceptionally repetitive, high volumes of user interactions will create opportunities for automated consent management once systems are established.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The system could enable significant insights from aggregated consent data, potentially identifying user preferences and trends that help refine AI interactions.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 5 – Scalability is promising since the decentralized nature allows for widespread adoption, but it will be limited by user education and technological readiness across different platforms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in consent management could lead to severe compliance issues, highlighting the need for robust error-checking systems, but the tolerance for individual user errors is moderately low.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 2 (original: 8)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Potential bias in consent gathering and usage requires careful monitoring, particularly to prevent underrepresentation of certain demographic groups, which poses significant ethical concerns.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 9 – The framework will need to navigate complex GDPR and other privacy laws, which impose stringent compliance timelines, potentially hindering implementation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 7 – Explainability will be vital as stakeholders will require clarity on how consent preferences are managed, making transparency a key design goal that could impact user trust and regulatory compliance.</div>
