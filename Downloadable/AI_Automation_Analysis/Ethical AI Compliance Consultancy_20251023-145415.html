              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 5</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 4 – The consultancy needs qualitative data on ethical standards and quantitative compliance metrics; while reasonable data may be available, its quality and standardization could vary significantly.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – Decision-making requires a combination of structured legal frameworks and subjective ethical considerations, making it moderately complex but feasible to automate aspects of the audit process.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integrating consultancy services with existing business frameworks may face some friction due to varying levels of existing AI maturity and compliance awareness, but foundational integration is achievable.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – Though compliance auditing tasks can be somewhat repetitive, the variability in each company's needs limits high-volume replication of services across different sectors.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – There’s strong potential for identifying patterns in compliance failures and ethical breaches, providing significant value as companies increasingly face scrutiny in these areas.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 6 – Consulting frameworks can scale across various sectors, but customization for industry-specific regulations and local compliance nuances may limit rapid growth.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 3 – Errors in this domain could lead to significant regulatory repercussions; thus, it necessitates a high standard of accuracy and investment in quality assurance.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The risk of bias in AI systems must be carefully evaluated and monitored, especially in relation to underrepresented groups, adding nuance and complexity to compliance strategies.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – With the increasing development of AI regulations (e.g., GDPR and emerging AI fairness laws), compliance consultancy is essential but can be complex and time-sensitive, impacting deliverability.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – There is a vital need for AI systems to maintain transparency, particularly in regulated environments; clients will demand clear and interpretable AI decision-making processes.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 5</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – The initiative requires qualitative and quantitative data on current AI deployments, which may vary in accessibility. While the data exists in some form, aggregating and standardizing it can be a challenge due to differing formats and organizational silos.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 4 – The framework involves subjective assessments regarding ethical considerations which complicate automation potential. There are numerous variables affecting decisions, such as organizational ethics policies and employee training, which may hinder straightforward automation.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – The integration of compliance auditing frameworks with existing business processes may require adjustments to current workflows, which can present friction points. However, since many businesses are already tracking compliance metrics, basic integration can begin without major overhauls.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 3 – While compliance auditing has repetitive elements across various clients, the tailored nature of consultative work reduces automation potential since each client's needs are unique. However, there is a volume of audits that businesses may need as regulations evolve.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 7 – The ability to analyze client AI deployment data could provide insights into common compliance pitfalls and ethical violations, offering significant value to clients. Pattern recognition can help predict risks and save future costs related to non-compliance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 6 – The consultancy could scale across different teams and industries, but the highly customized nature of service delivery limits rapid scalability. Developing a standardized framework could facilitate broader implementation but may dilute personalized service.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 5 – Errors in compliance auditing carry serious implications, including legal penalties and reputational damage. This necessitates a meticulous approach to reporting and assurance, which can slow down operations and reduce risk tolerance.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias risks are inherent if the consultancy does not adequately consider diverse perspectives in AI deployment. Addressing underrepresented groups might encounter challenges as it relies heavily on client transparency and willingness to disclose necessary data.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 8 – Given the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly around AI ethics (like GDPR and AI-specific fairness laws), the consultancy must remain agile to stay compliant, which ties into their core business value. There is a substantial risk if regulations are ignored.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 6 – Clients will require clear and comprehensible explanations of the compliance processes and any AI applications assessed. The need for transparency inherently affects how models and auditing processes are designed, increasing complexity in fulfilling these aspects.</div>
