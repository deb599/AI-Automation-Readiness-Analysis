              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 6</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 5 – The consultancy requires qualitative data related to AI practices, ethics, and regulations, which can be varied in quality and availability. While some regulatory guidelines are publicly available, many insights will come from direct client relationships, which may not always be accessible.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 7 – Decisions regarding ethical AI practices often require subjective judgment calls and varied stakeholder inputs, increasing complexity. However, established frameworks can guide these decisions, allowing for some automated reporting and analysis.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 6 – Integration with existing systems is moderately feasible, as businesses would need to adapt their current frameworks to incorporate ethical audits. Challenges include varying levels of maturity in AI practices across different organizations.</div>

              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 3 – The tasks involved in compliance consultancy, such as auditing and education, are less repetitive compared to other domains, limiting automation potential. However, the high stakes of compliance enforcement can create a strong business need.</div>

              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The consultancy model can be scaled through standardization of frameworks and digital training materials. However, personal advisory reliance may slow down rapid scaling across diverse sectors.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in compliance consultancy can lead to significant reputational damage and legal penalties for clients. While strict standards must be maintained, some degree of tolerance exists as clients are generally aware of the evolving nature of ethical AI.</div>
