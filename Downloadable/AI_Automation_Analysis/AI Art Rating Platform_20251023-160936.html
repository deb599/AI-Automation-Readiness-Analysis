    <p class="explanation">
      <strong>Go (≥67%):</strong> High potential for AI automation.<br>
      <strong>Wait (33–66%):</strong> Moderate potential – needs more analysis or risk control.<br>
      <strong>No-Go (<33%):</strong> Low potential – significant technical or compliance barriers.<br><br>
      Risk scores are inverted (higher risk = lower potential).<br>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 8</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 7 – The platform will require user-generated ratings and metadata about the artworks, which should be readily available through user input and existing image databases.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The rating system will need to balance subjective opinions while ensuring consistent quality standards, meaning some complexity in decision-making is expected.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 7 – Integration with existing social media platforms can enhance visibility and usability, although challenges in user authentication and data synchronization need consideration.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – The user rating process is repetitive, allowing for potential automation of aggregated analytics and user behaviors that can enhance user engagement.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The system can analyze user ratings to identify artistic trends and patterns, providing valuable insights that can guide artists and platforms alike.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – Once established, the platform has significant potential to scale across various art communities and geographic locations, although moderation challenges may arise.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – Errors in rating could misrepresent an artist’s work; however, the community-based approach allows for rapid feedback, minimizing long-term impact.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 3 (original: 7)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 6 – Bias in ratings may emerge based on user demographics; active measures would need to be employed to ensure a diverse user base and mitigate bias risks.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 5 – Although there are no explicit regulatory constraints currently affecting user-generated content, compliance with potential future regulations around AI fairness may require vigilance.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – While the transparency of ratings is vital, the subjective nature of art evaluation means some users may seek clear explanations for ratings, impacting how features are designed.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> 7</div>
              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 8 – The platform primarily relies on user-generated ratings and feedback, which are relatively straightforward to gather and analyze. However, ensuring the consistency and reliability of this data could pose challenges.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 6 – The decision-making process for rating content is subjective, which inherently complicates automation potential. However, leveraging community standards could help simplify this.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 5 – Integration with existing social media platforms could enhance reach, but may come with challenges due to differing data formats and API restrictions.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 7 – Rating AI art can produce high volumes of user interactions, creating substantial opportunities for engagement. However, the novelty of the ratings may lessen over time.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – The platform can help identify trends in art styles and user preferences, providing valuable insights for artists and curators, making it a highly relevant application.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 8 – The basic functionality can easily be scaled to accommodate more users and artworks, but maintaining quality and moderation could become increasingly complex.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 4 – Errors in the rating system could lead to misrepresentation of artists, affecting reputations; hence, a moderate tolerance level is necessary.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The subjective nature of art ratings may lead to bias or community favoritism. Furthermore, certain artists or styles may be unintentionally underrepresented in the data.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 4 – While there are fewer direct regulations governing rating platforms, user data management must adhere to privacy standards like GDPR, which will increase compliance costs.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – Users and artists may require understanding of how ratings are computed, though straightforward metrics can simplify this. Transparency in the algorithm will be crucial for building trust.</div>

              <div class="subscore">Data Requirements: 6 – The platform requires diverse art-related data for effective ratings. While user-generated content can provide rich feedback, the challenge lies in sourcing quality, labeled datasets for initial training.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Decision Complexity: 5 – The platform’s rating process involves subjective assessments, making it more complex than simple automation. However, community-driven ratings can help streamline decision-making with appropriate guidelines.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Integration: 8 – The platform can integrate easily with existing social media channels and art databases, enabling seamless user interaction and leveraging popular interfaces. Minimal friction is expected due to existing APIs.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Business Value:</strong> 9</div>
              <div class="subscore">Repetition / Volume: 4 – While the rating itself may not involve repetitive tasks, the potential for high user engagement can lead to significant volume in ratings and interactions over time, providing a vibrant ecosystem.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Pattern Recognition: 8 – There is substantial potential to analyze users' preferences and recognize emerging artistic trends, fulfilling a niche that can drive future art directions and community standards.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Scalability: 7 – The platform is inherently scalable; however, challenges may arise in maintaining quality control as user numbers grow, requiring robust moderation mechanisms.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Error Tolerance: 6 – The impact of errors could be moderate, potentially leading to misrepresentation of artists or their work. Therefore, implementing checks is vital to maintaining credibility.</div>

              <div class="subscore"><strong>Risk (Inverted):</strong> 4 (original: 6)</div>
              <div class="subscore">Bias Risk: 5 – The subjective nature of ratings may introduce bias, particularly if certain art styles or cultural backgrounds are unfairly favored. Strategies for diversity in user ratings can help mitigate this.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Regulatory: 4 – While general content regulations apply, the platform may face limited scrutiny. However, compliance with data protection laws, especially concerning user-generated content, must be prioritized.</div>
              <div class="subscore">Explainability: 5 – Users and artists may request insights into the rating process to understand how ratings are derived, necessitating a certain level of explainability in the algorithm to build trust.</div>
