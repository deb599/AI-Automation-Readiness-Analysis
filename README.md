## 🏗️ **Three-Stage Architecture**

### **Stage 1: Ideation** 

**Purpose:** Generate contrarian, hyper-specific startup/AI automation ideas from business content

**Process:**
```
Input: Business process/article in Google Doc
  ↓
[GPT-4o-mini: Contrarian Analysis]
  → Identify assumptions, blind spots, overlooked opportunities
  → Generate 3 ideas: Easy/Medium/Hard complexity
  → Output: title, painPoint, missedOppportunity, valueProposition, category, categoryJustification
  ↓
[Store in Google Sheets]
  → Structured data ready for Stage 2
```

**Key Prompt Strategy:**
- **Contrarian Thinking**: Challenge industry assumptions, find second-order effects
- **Hyper-Specific Niches**: Not "freelancers" but "technical writers in B2B SaaS"
- **Tactical Problems**: Not "help businesses grow" but "automate sales battlecards from call transcripts"
- **Risk Awareness**: What breaks at scale? What barriers exist?

**Output Fields:**
```json
{
  "id": "Source Google Document id",
  "title": "Ultra-specific idea title",
  "painPoint": "Painful current state with specific behaviors/costs",
  "missedOpportunity": "Why NOT acting now causes lost opportunities",
  "valueProposition": "Specific tactical outcome with metrics",
  "category": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
  "categoryJustification": "PM-level reasoning for complexity"
}
```

### **Stage 2: Epic-Level Feasibility Assessment** 

**Purpose:** Break ideas into MVPs, generate epics, and assess AI automation potential using structured frameworks

**Process:**

```
[Fetch Ideas from Stage 1 (Google Sheets)]
  ↓
[Agent 1: Epic Generator]
  → Break process into 2-3 MVP epics
  → Define: title, description, successCriteria, complexity, dependencies
  → Output: Structured JSON with MVPGoal + epics[]
  ↓
[Split Epics → Loop]
  ↓
[Agent 2: AI Suitability Assessor (per epic)]
  → Assess 3 dimensions:
    • Technical Feasibility (0-10)
      - dataRequirements, decisionComplexity, integration
    • Business Value (0-10)
      - repetitionVolume, patternRecognition, scalability, errorTolerance
    • Risk/Compliance (0-10, inverted)
      - biasRisk, regulatory, explainability
  → Each sub-score includes 1-2 sentence reasoning
  ↓
[Total Score Calculator (JavaScript)]
  → Normalize risk (high risk = low potential)
  → totalScore = techScore + bizScore + (10 - riskScore)
  → Classification: High (≥20), Moderate (10-19), Low (<10)
  
```

**Key Prompt Strategy (AI Suitability):**
```
Apply AI Readiness Framework
- Dynamic reasoning (realistic highs/lows, not all moderate)
- Pull context from previous agents (category justification, beforeState)
- Concrete reasoning (1-2 sentences per sub-score)
- Reference: workflow complexity, data availability, regulatory impact
- Objective assessment (don't assume ideal conditions)
```


---

### **Stage 3: Executive Publishing** 

**Purpose:** Generate HTML reports summarising the assessment from Stage 2

**Process:**
```
[Aggregate All Epics]
  ↓
[HTML Report Generator (JavaScript)]
  → Overall verdict: Go (≥67%), Wait (33-66%), No-Go (<33%)
  → Collapsible epic breakdowns
  → Color-coded risk visualization
  ↓
[Publish to GitHub]
  → Path: Downloadable/AI_Automation_Analysis/{process}_{timestamp}.html
  ↓
[Update Google Sheets]
  → Store all epic assessments with detailed scoring
```

**Scoring Methodology:**
```javascript
// Risk is INVERTED (high risk = bad for automation)
normalizedRiskScore = 10 - rawRiskScore

// Total per epic (max 30)
totalScore = technicalFeasibility + businessValue + normalizedRiskScore

// Overall verdict (all epics combined)
percentageScore = (totalScoreSum / (epicCount * 30)) * 100

// Classification
if (percentageScore >= 67) → "Go" (High Potential)
if (33-66) → "Wait" (Moderate - needs analysis)
if (<33) → "No-Go" (Low Potential - significant barriers)
```

**HTML Report Features:**
- 📊 **Header**: Epic count, total score, percentage, MVP goal
- 🚦 **Verdict Banner**: Color-coded Go/Wait/No-Go with percentage
- 📖 **Collapsible Details**: 
  - Technical Feasibility breakdown (data, complexity, integration)
  - Business Value breakdown (repetition, patterns, scalability, error tolerance)
  - Risk breakdown (bias, regulatory, explainability) with inverted scoring
- ⏰ **Timestamp**: Generation date/time

## 📊 **Assessment Framework: AI Readiness**

### **Dimension 1: Technical Feasibility (0-10)**

**Sub-Categories:**
- **Data Requirements** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Limited historical customer interaction data reduces model accuracy; requires 6-12 months data collection before viable training."
  
- **Decision Complexity** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Highly subjective editorial decisions with context-dependent nuance limit pure automation; hybrid approach needed."
  
- **Integration** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Integration with legacy ERP via REST API adds 2-3 months complexity; modern SaaS tools would simplify significantly."

### **Dimension 2: Business Value (0-10)**

**Sub-Categories:**
- **Repetition/Volume** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Manual process repeated 500+ times daily across 20 team members offers significant automation ROI."
  
- **Pattern Recognition** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Anomaly detection in transaction logs shows 85% predictive accuracy in pilot; high value for fraud prevention."
  
- **Scalability** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Process replicable across 15 departments with minimal customization; template-driven approach enables rapid scaling."
  
- **Error Tolerance** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Low tolerance in financial compliance decisions limits autonomous AI; requires human-in-loop for all flagged cases."

### **Dimension 3: Risk/Compliance (0-10, INVERTED)**

**Sub-Categories:**
- **Bias Risk** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Training data underrepresents demographics in rural regions (18% coverage); creates fairness risk requiring mitigation."
  
- **Regulatory** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "GDPR Article 22 right-to-explanation significantly constrains automated decision-making; deep learning models non-viable."
  
- **Explainability** (0-10)
  - *Example reasoning:* "Auditors require explainable logic per ISO 27001; neural networks unsuitable, decision trees or rule-based preferred."

**Why Risk is Inverted:**
```
High Risk Score (e.g., 8/10) = High Compliance Barriers
→ Inverted to (10 - 8) = 2/10 contribution to automation potential
→ Reflects that high risk = low suitability for automation
```

## 🚀 **Key Innovations**

### **1. Contrarian Ideation Engine**
- **Not:** Generic "AI for X" ideas
- **But:** Hyper-specific niches with tactical problem-solving
- **Example:** Not "AI for freelancers" but "AI-generated sales battlecards from customer call transcripts for B2B SaaS technical writers"

### **2. Dynamic Risk-Aware Scoring**
- **Innovation:** Risk dimension is **inverted** in total score calculation
- **Rationale:** High regulatory risk should **decrease** automation suitability
- **Formula:** `normalizedRisk = 10 - rawRiskScore`
- **Impact:** Prevents "high-score bias" for risky AI applications

### **3. Context-Aware Epic Assessment**
- **Agent 2 pulls context** from Agent 1 outputs (category justification, beforeState, failureFOMO)
- **No isolated scoring** - reasoning references prior analysis
- **Example:** "Given the 'Easy' category classification and high repetition volume identified earlier, data requirements score 8/10 due to readily available CRM logs."

### **4. Realistic Scoring Distribution**
- **Prompt explicitly requires:** "Use dynamic reasoning, provide realistic highs and lows, don't default to moderate"
- **Prevents:** All epics scoring 5-6/10 (common LLM behavior)
- **Ensures:** True differentiation between high-potential and low-potential automations

## 📝 **Workflow Customization**

### **Adjust Scoring Weights:**

Edit `total score1` node JavaScript:
```javascript
// Current: Equal weighting
const totalScore = techScore + bizScore + normalizedRiskScore;

// Custom: Weight business value 2x
const totalScore = techScore + (bizScore * 2) + normalizedRiskScore;

// Custom: Heavily penalize high risk
const normalizedRiskScore = (10 - riskScore) * 1.5;
```

### **Change Verdict Thresholds:**

Edit `Generate HTML and Report` node JavaScript:
```javascript
// Current thresholds
const verdictStatus = percentageScore >= 67 ? 'Go' 
  : (percentageScore >= 33 ? 'Wait' : 'No-Go');

// Custom: More aggressive
const verdictStatus = percentageScore >= 80 ? 'Go' 
  : (percentageScore >= 50 ? 'Wait' : 'No-Go');
```

### **Add New Assessment Dimensions:**

Modify Agent 2 prompt in `3. Assess AI Suitability`:
```json
"organizationalReadiness": {
  "score": 0,
  "changeManagement": { "score": 0, "reason": "..." },
  "skillsAvailability": { "score": 0, "reason": "..." },
  "budgetAlignment": { "score": 0, "reason": "..." }
}
```
